    <meta name="description" content="Hi there! I am a 20 years old student of IT Systems Engineering at the Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam/Germany. I am interested in web and app development, in maker projects, as well as in Competitive Programming and I have been the head of the website student society at the faculty ever since my first semester. I am strongly familiar with JavaScript (both front end and back end) and gained a lot of experience working with it. Nevertheless, I also feel very comfortable programming in C and C++. In my spare time I do track and field.">
